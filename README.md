GRNmap
======

Gene Regulatory Network modeling and parameter estimation
---

System Requirements and Compatibility:
* The GRNmap code was developed and tested with MATLAB R2014b; it may not function properly with other versions of MATLAB.
* GRNmap is only compatible with the Windows operating system because of the function it uses to read and write Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. It has only been tested on Windows 7.
* We recommend running GRNmap with a minimum of 8.00 GB of RAM and a 2.40 GHz processor. GRNmap may be compatible with slower systems; the amount of RAM and processor speed will affect the speed with which GRNmap completes the estimation.
